# Canonical State — Alquileres Uspallata Cloudflare Lab

State: `PENDING_EXTERNAL_REVIEW`
Phase: `DISCOVERY / FEASIBILITY`
Active task: `CF-AU-I00 — Baseline, feasibility and cost-zero validation`

## Source baseline

- Source repository: `sjo1848/alquileres-uspa` (read-only reference).
- Source repository main at lab bootstrap: `cff14159daa1698a9ee04ea317c4a2c356112ae0`.
- Current product candidate underlying that source state: I13 candidate `8e11bebdb197321d500678f06233d6f174f03438`.
- I13 Human Product Acceptance in the source project is still pending at bootstrap. Therefore CF-AU-I00 may research/validate migration feasibility, but substantive parity implementation must not silently assume I13 is permanently accepted.

## Authorized work

CF-AU-I00 is authorized to:

- inventory source architecture and behavior;
- pin parity surfaces and migration scope;
- validate Workers/D1/R2 feasibility;
- validate application-auth compatibility on Workers;
- map PostgreSQL/Prisma schema and migrations to a D1/SQLite strategy;
- validate image-object flow to R2;
- build a zero-cost usage model against current Cloudflare free-tier limits;
- define falsification criteria and the next bounded migration increment;
- produce reproducible evidence and a Pre-Critic package.

CF-AU-I00 is NOT authorized to:

- deploy production;
- use real customer data;
- create paid resources or accept recurring cost;
- change product semantics;
- declare the target architecture proven before evidence;
- begin a broad migration implementation without closing feasibility and source-product dependency.

## Working target hypothesis

`Vue 3 + Vite Static Assets → Cloudflare Workers`

`API → Workers + Hono + TypeScript`

`PostgreSQL/Prisma → D1/SQLite-compatible persistence`

`Listing images → R2`

Application authentication/authorization semantics remain parity-first.

## Research framing

This project is a second Cloudflare migration laboratory alongside HMS Cloudflare. It exists to test whether the Project Method and Cloudflare architecture generalize to a different application topology and domain.

A cross-project thesis is not yet authorized as fact. It may only be formulated after evidence from both labs supports or falsifies reusable claims.

## Next action

Commit the completed CF-AU-I00 evidence package as an immutable artifact, then wait for the External Independent Critic verdict.
